            <img src="profile.png" alt="Sunny Nishad" class="profile-img" />
            <p>
                My name is Sunny Nishad, a passionate graphic designer from Dongargarh, Chhattisgarh. I completed my
                schooling and graduation from Paonta Sahib, Himachal Pradesh. Initially enrolled in BCA with
                expectations towards technology, I discovered my true calling in the field of graphic design. I have
                gained hands-on experience in tools like Canva, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and CorelDRAW. I'm keen on
                learning advanced tools like After Effects and Blender professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to limited resources, I’ve worked mostly on lightweight tools, but my dedication and creativity have
                driven me to consistently upskill. I aspire to work in a metro city environment where collaboration,
                creativity, and professional growth are valued. I'm a quick learner, a strong team player, and
                constantly push myself toward excellence.

                <p>An online store prototype built to simulate real-time product listing and categorization.
                    This is a homepage design for a conceptual e-commerce website named Solenoid, created using HTML and

                    tools were used for layout planning and code reference, but the entire structure, styling, and

                <h3>Designs & Posters</h3><br>
                <h4>Dress Illustrations (Adobe Illustrator)</h4>
                Three original fashion designs focusing on traditional and modern wear. Created using Adobe Illustrator,
                these works demonstrate my understanding of color harmony, garment structure, and digital illustration
                techniques. Each piece was conceptualized with design thinking and visual balance in mind.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Logo Designs (Adobe Illustrator)</h4>
                A set of clean, impactful logos designed for branding purposes. These showcase minimalism, symmetry, and
                conceptual clarity — essential aspects for strong visual identity. Designed entirely using Illustrator
                tools with a focus on adaptability for both digital and print.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Poster Designs (Canva)</h4>
                Designed for the PMKY campaign and general awareness themes, these posters communicate messages visually
                with clarity and purpose. Using Canva's layout tools creatively, I maintained focus on typography,
                alignment, and color usage. These posters were structured with modern composition rules and
                accessibility in mind.
                <br><br>
                <h4>Tools Used:</h4><br>
